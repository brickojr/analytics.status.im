# Analytics for Status

Scripts, links and sheets to calculate important metrics.

Right now:
- Monthly Active Contributors
- Monthly Contributor Retention Rate

Currently semi-manual and relying on Google Docs. At some point this will be scripted up and produced for general consumption. Only measures commits for status-react and some comparative-ish projects.

Why measure? See Android app example usage for impact, as well as organizational design. For further information, see FB Growth video linked below.
